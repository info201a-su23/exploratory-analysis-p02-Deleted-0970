### Abstract

Providing a data visualization that presents a comprehensive investigation into 
the impact of climate change between the years 1750 and 2015, employing temporal
and trend-line mapping techniques to explore the evolution of climate-related
parameters, and provide discernment for the individual factors influencing
climate change over time and their respective influence. The objective of this
data visualization is to enhance understanding of the drivers of climate change,
enabling more accurate projections of future climate scenarios. Considering the
prevailing climate emergency, a motivation for this data visualization project
is to provide valuable insights towards cultivating a more
environmentally-conscious world.

### Keywords

(Climate Change, Geographic Data, Atmospheric Science, Time series data)

### Introduction  

The question that this project will answer is how climate temperature has
changed over time. Climate change is an important issue globally, and being able
to understand the progression of climate change is important data for creating
action. To address this question, a series of visualizations derived from a
dataset will be created; a temporal map, showing a heatmap laid over a world
map, a bubble chart that represents the difference in heat by year, an area
graph representing temperature over time with a slider to alter the time
interval, and a line chart that depicts the overall velocity of temperature
change over time from 1750 to now, knowing that earth temperatures have been
relatively stable before 1750 throughout recent human history. 
The velocity at which the temperature is changing overall is also of concern,
because it can be used to set the trendline for making future predictions. As
a result, there are many factors the data provides that are worth identifying
such as: 

* How has global temperature changed over time?
* What is the velocity of temperature change throughout time?
* Which continent/country/city experienced the greatest changes in temperature
over time?
* Other questions worth considering while exploring this dataset include:
* What major historical events have taken place in this timeline that may have
influenced the climate?
* What does the trend in temperature suggest about the future?

Finding answers to these questions is important since they will ensure
scientific accountability, raise awareness in large audiences, maintain
documentation of historical data, and hopefully advocate for international
collaboration. It is important to consider that this data set has some
limitations; the data dates back to 1750, all the way up to 2017. While this is
a large dataset, it isn’t necessarily the most updated representation of the
climate today since it excludes the previous six years of data. Therefore a
trendline for future predictions may be helpful to use and compare with current
temperatures for accuracy. This dataset lacks granular data for every place on
the globe, a limitation of this dataset. The missing data is notable because it
inhibits the accuracy of the data representation and it will be countered by
supplying more refined data on the location and date of significant temperature
changes over time by cities.

### Related Work  

The topic under investigation pertains to the temporal rate of climate
temperature change. Given the contentious nature of climate change, a plethora
of 'information' on its effects and causes exists. Accessing reliable sources
such as academic journals or the platforms of esteemed scientific organizations
like the UN, NOAA, or NASA is recommended.

* The **UN** provides a ‘[Climate Action Note](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/climate-action/what-we-do/climate-action-note/state-of-climate.html)’, which provides data maps on the increase of emissions since
1990. This data set provides interactive data maps on climate change per total
emissions and capita emissions, by country. What is most interesting about this
particular data set is that they provide economic data on the countries
contributing to climate change as well. This is beneficial in understanding
the very real economic disparities between countries, and how that affects
carbon emissions. For example, by analyzing the economic welfare of each
individual country in the data set, the UN found that the poorest countries only
make up half of carbon emissions. The top 1% of the globe represents more than
twice these emissions. This information is useful in understanding how to
disseminate resources and support to countries in need (Benjamin 2023).

* The **NOAA** provides a '[Global Climate Dashboard](https://www.climate.gov/climatedashboard)', which provides 18
different line graphs ranging from Greenhouse Gases, Sea Level, and Surface
Temperature to Ocean Heat, Spring Snow, and sunlight by metric. There are two
indicator options, filtered between ‘climate change’ and ‘natural variability’ 
which increases the confidence in correlation between the state of the climate 
crisis which accelerated at a rate that went beyond what was natural for that 
particular time period or environment.

* **NASA** provides data on the '[Vital Signs of our Planet](https://climate.nasa.gov/)'
, the data provides information on Carbon Dioxide (parts per million), Global
Temperature (degrees in Celsius since the pre industrial period), Methane
(parts per billion), Arctic Sea Ice Extent (min percent per decade since ‘79),
Ice sheets(by billion metric ton per year), Sea Level (inches since 1993), and
Ocean Warming (zetta-joules since 1955). By extracting these indicators, NASA
provides a closer look at the different natural elements that are affected, and
how drastically they have changed over time. When opened, each data-set provides
either a trend-line graph, a regular line graph, or a temporal world map that is
interactive.

All of these articles provide additional supporting data and impact to the
questions we are trying to answer, but more than that, they are all coming from
major scientific organizations that are credible, reliable, and actively
involved in providing systemic solutions to the climate crisis. The goal of this
project is to create data visualizations which contribute to the accessibility
of climate data information, in a way that is readable and understandable to an
audience.


### The Dataset

Dataset biography:

* This data was found on Kaggle. The data set can be found here: [Climate Change Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalTemperatures.csv)

* The data was collected by [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/) and [Kristen Sissener](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristensissener/)

Data collection methodology:

* There are several different ways this data was collected because the data
dates all the way back to 1750, it is difficult to have consistent measurement.
Early periods of temperature data were gathered using mercury thermometers, post
1940’s construction moved weather stations around, and the 1980’s introduced a
device known to have a cooling bias; digital thermometers. There were 16
different data archives with a whopping 1.6 billion individual temperature
records reported. Berkeley Earth divided the data into categories based on min,
max, confidence intervals, global scale, by specific location, and by date.

* This data was collected to identify location indicators affecting climate
temperature change over time. Authors Berkeley Earth and Kristen Sissener
acknowledge the ongoing debate on whether climate change is a real issue, and
collected this wide range of temporal data by location in order to represent a
seemingly unbiased data set for analysis. By providing data based on location
rather than population per capita, the data eradicates any room for
socioeconomic debate and only provides space to analyze the correlation between
date and location in temporal history.

Dimensions of dataset
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("analysis.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
library(knitr)
dim_table <- get_dim()
knitr::kable(dim_table)
```

Some ethical questions considered when working with this data include...

* Is the data representative of the global population?

  * Considering that there is no information on each individual place across
  the world, the data will not provide very high confidence of causation or
  correlation between environmental placement and its impact. In order to do so,
  there would need to be granular data provided for each and every individual
  city, state, and country worldwide. Knowing that this data set spans across
  such a large amount of time, it is fair to assume this would not be a
  possibility to provide, however the ethical dilemma of representation within
  the data-set still very much stands.

* Does the data have a motive or an agenda behind it?
  
  * Knowing that climate change is not just a scientific problem, but also a
  highly politicized issue forces the consideration of integrity behind the data
  collection. What is being left out? How do the indicators selected create gaps
  in our data set? Are these gaps intentional or causal? It is important to
  consider these questions when approaching these data sets in order to consider
  the marginalized groups. Because we know that the poorest countries in the
  world lack resources that would provide them with environmental preservation
  efforts, it would be unethical to assume the baseline for each country remains
  the same.

It is important to consider that this data set has some limitations; the data
dates back to 1750, all the way up to 2015. While this is a large data-set, it
isn’t necessarily the most updated representation of the climate today since it
excludes the previous six years of data. Therefore a trend-line for future
predictions may be helpful to use and compare with current temperatures for
accuracy. This data-set also lacks granular data for all surface locations on
the globe, another limitation of this data-set. The missing data is notable
because it inhibits the accuracy of the data representation.


### Implications

When addressing the challenge of climate change, technologists, designers, and
Policymakers are the result of addressing tangible solutions for the future of
climate change and how we understand its data. The fusion of innovative
technologies with sustainable design that is supported and enforced by effective
policies ensures the acceleration of the ways sustainable practices across the
globe will ensure a more environmentally-conscious future.

* Technologists: Knowing the climate is in a state of emergency, technologists
have the resources, and understanding, and will play a crucial role in
developing sustainable solutions and green technologies. This includes renewable
energy sources, energy-efficient infrastructure, climate monitoring systems, and
advanced data analytics to inform decision-making.
* Designers: Sustainable design practices will be essential to mitigate the
impact of climate change. Designers should prioritize eco-friendly materials,
energy-efficient buildings, and resilient infrastructure to adapt to changing
environmental conditions.
* Policymakers: Policymakers have the responsibility to implement effective
climate policies, promote international cooperation, and enforce environmental
regulations. This may include carbon pricing, emission reduction targets, and
incentives for adopting clean technologies.

### Limitations & Challenges

Possible limitations or problems when working with this particular dataset are
concerns of the locations being represented. Knowing that this data set does not
have granular time series data for each individual city, state, or country as it
is aggregated monthly. It is important to consider how this presents
difficulties when deciphering events with the highest or lowest impact on the
climate. Alternatively, the information provided comes from a multitude of
different measurement sources dating all the way back to the pre-industrial
revolution. The ways in which temperature measurements are gathered today are
different than they were in 1750, and the results of these measurements reflect
that. The authors of this data set mention that they collected data from
measurements based off of very dated instruments, such as mercury thermometers
of the pre-industrial age, and the digital thermometers used in the late 1900’s,
which are known to have a cooling bias.

These concerns question not only the integrity of the data’s accuracy and
precision, but also the invisible power structures that it represents. It i
s clear not every location was capable of being held accountable for proper
measuring techniques, therefore the data collected must consider those
disparities. There is missing data for many countries and cities before 1850,
there is even more missing data for Antarctica. Additionally, considering the
main question to answer is how temperature of the climate has changed over time,
the data limits or completely dismisses the ability to extract individual
variables that also represent environmental indicators of significant climate
change such as ocean heat levels or snow melt in the spring. This is important
because these factors are crucial in determining temperature change over time,
arguably more so than analyzing indicators based on location.

### Summary Information
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("summary.R")
```

Between the years 1750 and 2015, the average global temperature has experienced
a significant change, with an average increase of approximately
`r avg_global_temp_change`°C. In 1752, the minimum average temperature was
recorded at `r lowest_global_temp`°C, while in 2015, the maximum average
temperature reached `r highest_global_temp`°C. A notable temperature of `r median_global_temp`°C was observed in 1906 as the median average temperature
during this period. Finally, we can calculate the mean of these temperatures:
Mean temperature = (1752 * 5.779833 + 2015 * 9.831 + 1906 * 8.379083) /
(1752 + 2015 + 1906). This equation gives us a mean temperature finding of
approximately 8.04 degrees Celsius.
Overall, this means that given the values found in our data set, the overall
mean temperature for the years ranging from 1750-2015 is roughly 8.04 degrees
Celsius. 

We found:

* Between 1750 to 2015 the average change in land temperature globally is: 
`r avg_global_temp_change` C
* The lowest global land average temperature since 1750 was in 1752 at 
`r lowest_global_temp` C
* The highest global land average temperature since 1750 was in 2015 at 
`r highest_global_temp` C
* The median temperature globally by year occurred in 1906 and is 
`r median_global_temp` C
* The average temperature between 1750 and 2015 was 
`r average_global_temp` C

From the data visualizations, we noticed that temperatures increased across 
the globe since 1750. the greatest changes in temperature occurred in 
cities located in northern Asian and East Europe.
Furthermore, the velocity of temperature change has been consistently above 0 
from 1750 to 2015 meaning that average temperatures have been increasing yearly.
We can can also see that temperature change was decelerating 
from 1750 to around 1930, but from 1930 to 2015, temperature change suddenly
began to accelerate. 
Additionally, we can see that the uncertainty of data begins to 
steadily decrease over time as technology for temperature data collection tools 
improved continuously.
Finally, we noticed that while North America and Asia have similar
latitudes, the difference between average temperature varies significantly with
Asia at around ~10C while North America has an average temperature at
around ~5C.

### Table

This table is included to give a more detailed understanding of our global data
summary statistics, this table includes average land and sea temperatures as
well as the confidence interval for each calculation.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("analysis.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
global_summary_table <- global_annual_summary() %>%
  reframe(
    `Date` = dt,
    `Event` = event_type,
    `LandTemp` = round(LandAverageTemperature, 2),
    `TempConfidence` = round(LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty, 2),
    `MaxTemp` = round(LandMaxTemperature, 2),
    `MaxTempConfidence` = round(LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty, 2),
    `MinTemperature` = round(LandMinTemperature, 2),
    `MinTempConfidence` = round(LandMinTemperatureUncertainty, 2)
  )
knitr::kable(global_summary_table)
```

### Chart 1: Heat Map / Bubble Chart on World Map

These two maps are included to provide an overview of the current situation of
our climate. The *Average Temperature By Country* visualization shows
average temperatures of each country around the world in Celsius (2015). 
The second visualization, *City Temperature Changes*, provides an
idea of changes of temperature over time. The map shows average
temperature changes in each city from 1750 to 2015.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(scales) # for map creation
library(maps) # for map creation
library(plotly) # interactive plot

source("chart1.R")
source("chart3.R")

temp_map

city_plot
```

From the first visualization shows that countries near the equator tend to
have higher temperatures (we plan on including a slider widget in shiny so
that we can visualize average temperatures over time). The second visualization
shows average change in temperature between 1750 and 2015 in major cities. 
While temperatures increased across the globe, the greatest changes in 
temperature occurred in cities located in northern Asian and East Europe.

### Chart 2: Scatterplot with Bubbles

This scatter plot is included to show the velocity of temperature change 
over the years along with the certainty of the data. A loess regression is also
included to help visualize the change in velocity of temperature change over
time (acceleration of temperature change). This can provide insight on not only
the overall trend of temperature change, but also show changes in temperature
collection technology.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, code = readLines("chartTest.R")}
```

From this scatter plot, we can see that the velocity of temperature change
is consistently above 0 meaning that it is on average increasing yearly.
However, we can can also see that temperature change was decelerating 
from 1750 to around 1930. From 1930 to 2015, temperature change began to 
accelerate. Additionally, we can see that the uncertainty of data begins to 
steadily decrease over time as technological advancements are made.

### Chart 3: Bar Graph

This bar chart is included to compare average temperatures of each continent.
The comparison can allow for more detailed examination of differences in 
temperature between continents that are a similar distance from the equator.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, code = readLines("chart2.R")}
```

This visualization shows that while North America and Asia have similar
latitudes, the difference between average temperature varies significantly with
Asia at around ~10C while North America has an average temperature at
around ~5C.
As with the heat map of the world, we hope to enhance the amount of insight this
visualization can give with widgets from shiny.
